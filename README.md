<h1 align="center">Turtle Race</h1>

I was tasked to create a Turtle Race in my class, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Wu. I am taking this Udemy class on the side of my official coursework at Western Governors University. This is day nineteen of the class.

<h2>I was to focus on using the following concepts that I learned today.</h2>

-OOP

-Multiple instances of same class.

-Varying states between said instances

<h2>What I learned</h2>
This time working with OOP I was introduced to the main power of it, multiple instances with varying states. I understand the power of OOP now and it is really begining to click.

<h2>Issues I had and where I can do better.</h2>
I think I can refine my loop for creating the multiple instances of turtles.
